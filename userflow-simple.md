# InOrbyt User Flow Guide
## The Reward Layer for the Creator Economy

---

## What is InOrbyt?

**InOrbyt** is a platform that helps creators reward their Discord community automatically. Fans earn tokens for engagement, and perks unlock automatically as they reach milestones. **MVP starts with Discord** (other platforms coming soon). Think of it as a reward layer that works with your existing Discord server.

### The Problem We Solve
- **Creators** struggle to recognize and reward engaged Discord community members
- **Fans** want to support creators but don't get recognition
- **Engagement goes unnoticed** - active fans feel unappreciated
- **Manual reward systems** are too time-consuming

### Our Solution (MVP)
- **Automatic rewards** for Discord engagement (no manual work needed)
- **Non-transferable tokens** that unlock perks (not for trading)
- **Discord-first** integration (other platforms coming soon)
- **One dashboard** to manage rewards and perks
- **Zero crypto knowledge** required

## Common Questions (MVP)

### "Do I need to understand cryptocurrency?"
**No.** Your wallet is created automatically when you sign in with Discord. You never see any crypto complexity - just tokens and perks.

### "Can I buy or sell tokens?"
**No.** MVP tokens are reward-only and non-transferable. They're earned through Discord engagement and used to unlock perks - no trading involved.

### "Do I need to move my Discord community?"
**No.** Your Discord server stays exactly where it is. InOrbyt just adds a reward layer on top - your members stay in Discord.

### "When will Patreon/YouTube/Substack be available?"
**Coming soon.** MVP starts with Discord to prove the concept. Other platforms will follow the same automatic reward structure.

### "How do rewards work?"
**Automatically!** When you engage in Discord (messages, roles, events), tokens are issued automatically. No claiming needed - they just appear in your wallet.

### "What are perks?"
**Exclusive rewards** that unlock automatically when you reach token milestones. Examples: special Discord roles, early access channels, unique badges.

### "Is this safe?"
**Yes.** We use Discord OAuth for authentication (same security as Discord), and all events are verified through Discord's official API.

### "What if I don't have many Discord members?"
**That's okay.** Even small communities can benefit. Start with 10 members and watch engagement grow as members get rewarded.
